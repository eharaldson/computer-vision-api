# computer-vision-api
API that takes in an image and makes a prediction.

- In this mini project I have created an api to run on my local machine using FastAPI. It can be used to classify an image using the mobilevnet 2.0 computer vision model from pytorch.
- To use it, you can post a file either by encoding it in base64 or uploading the file directly (Both options have functions to use them in the test_computer_vision_api.py file).
